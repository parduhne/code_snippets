Work I have done in group projects

# Recipe Retriever
## Description: 
Create a Web App that searches for recipes based on what you have in your pantry
## Contributions:
**All-recipes API:** This api returns all of the recipes with their respective ingredients from the database. I wrote this api as well as the SQL statement that works with it.
**Recipe View:** This is a React view which calls the All-recipes API and then formats the data into viewable content.
**web_scraper.py:** This script grabbed all of the recipe info from https://www.liquor.com including the url,name, ingredient and ingredient size. This data was then used to fill out our database for the project.
# CAOA LMS
## Desciption:
Make an extension that works with Google Classroom to add a workflow function and a reward system
## Contributions: 
**Python Quickstart:** This is the initial script used to excercise and experiement with the google classroom API. I wrote and used this to educate my groupmates on some of the APIs that would be useful for our project.
